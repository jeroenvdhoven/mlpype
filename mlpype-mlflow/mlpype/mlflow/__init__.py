At the moment, MLflow is the recommended logging tool for MLpype. This package provides 2 main tools:

- An MlflowLogger: An MLpype logger that uses MLflow. Set this up and you don't have to worry about how to\
    log your model.
- A quick function to load an Inferencer from an experiment stored in MLflow.
